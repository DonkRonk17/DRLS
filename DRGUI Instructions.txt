We are going to create addons for the video game World of Warcraft. 

My xAI API Key is:
YOUR_XAI_API_KEY_HERE

Please create an addon that sets up  a UI for the game and these UI profiles can be saved and exported in-game. These profiles would be unique to each race, class, spec and hero talent tree combination in the game We'll call it "DRGUI" (for DonkRonk and Grok User Interface). I would also like to implement some sort of AI assistance, specifically with Grok, 4 when installing the addon to make it easier for the user and give them a unique experience for every race, class, spec and hero talent combo available. The addon should autodetect what the character's race, class, spec and hero talents they are when they log into the game for that character. Any other features you think this addon should have? I'm thinking about animations, unique character icons and borders, AI assistance in-game, etc. Please get creative!

I would like to create an ElvUI-based addon for my characters; a unique, creative, minimalistic, cartoony (like Bushido), action packed UI for my World of Warcraft character. hese are the current addons I have that you can utilize to create this UI addon: ElvUI, Bagnon, Bartender4, BigWigs Encounter Tools, Compact Runes, DBM - Deadly Boss Mods (DBM-Core), DBM - Dungeons, Delves, Visions, & Events (Requires Deadly Boss Mods) - DBM, DBM-Interrupts, Cast Log (Details!

We will be using programs like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to create the files necessary. World of Warcraft (WoW) add-ons primarily use the Lua programming language. While some layout elements can be created using XML, the core functionality and logic of an addon is written in Lua. Additionally, WoW uses a specific version of Lua (5.1). 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Lua:
This is the main language used for WoW addons. You'll write scripts in Lua to handle in-game events, interact with the user interface, and implement the addon's features. 
XML:
While not a programming language, XML is used to define the layout of the UI elements in an addon. 
WoW API:
Blizzard provides a set of functions (the WoW API) that addons can use to interact with the game, such as getting player information, triggering spells, or manipulating the UI. 
Example:
A simple addon might involve creating a Lua script that listens for a specific combat event, then uses the API to display a message on the screen
